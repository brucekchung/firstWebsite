					<h2>Mizuna</h2>
					<h3>Capitol Hill</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>"Anyone remotely familiar with Mizuna, Chef Frank Bonanno’s French-inspired flagship restaurant in Denver’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, knows exactly what to get: the long-standing, much-ballyhooed lobster macaroni and cheese. It’s completely anti-ethical if you’re obsessed with having a Barbie doll waistline, but for the rest of us that revel in the sensuality of butter and cream, coupled with the ultra-richness of mascarpone and sweet Maine lobster flesh, it’s the kind of heart-racing dish that stirs up lusty emotions normally reserved for a different kind of love."<br/>-Food Network</p><br />

					<h3>LoDo</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>"Chef Troy Guard, whose restaurant empire encompasses six different brands, hails from Hawaii, so it’s no surprise that the scroll at Tag Restaurant, his flagship Denver restaurant, is anchored by fish and seafood, most notably the char-etched miso-marinated black cod, a masterful assembly that’s held in awe by just about everyone who’s a fan of fin. And it’s also a plate that has Guard’s signature Asian-fusion John Hancock all over it: shelled edamame beans, shiitake mushrooms, artichokes, sweet cipollini onions and leeks looped with a spin of yuzu kabayaki, a slightly sweet Japanese sauce that pairs beautifully with the fish."<br/>-Food Network</p>

					<h2>My Brother's Bar</h2>
					<h3>Highland Park</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>"The double-fisted burger from My Brother’s Bar, a decades-old corner tavern that’s devoid of signage, is the equivalent of a culinary artifact. It’s been a staple for more than 40 years, wooing Denverites and sojourners alike with its duo of thin patties paved with properly melted Swiss and American cheeses, a smear of cream cheese and grilled onions, all tucked between two sesame seed-dotted bun halves wrapped in wax paper. It really doesn’t require embellishments, but if you insist on extra flourishes, there’s an accompanying condiment tray stocked with bowls of pepperoncini, raw onions, pickles, relish and more."<br/>-Food Network</p>

					<h2>ChoLon Modern Asian Bistro</h2>
					<h3>LoDo</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>"In Denver’s culinary circles, you really can’t utter Chef Lon Symensma’s name without interjecting superlatives about his soup dumplings. They’ve graced the menu of ChoLon Modern Asian Bistro from the beginning, and while Symensma frequently flecks his Southeast Asian board with captivating new knockouts, the soup dumplings are his indisputable hallmark (his kaya toast with coconut jam and “egg cloud” is a close second). Propped in a dim sum basket, the pliable dumplings, plumped with sweet caramelized onions, nutty Gruyere and a broth fragrant with sherry and thyme, are one of the best bites that will ever pass through your lips.
